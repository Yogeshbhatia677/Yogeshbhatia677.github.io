			<p id="para04">  <ul>
				<li>The kitchen sink can carry up to 100,000 times the number of germs as the bathroom. Use a disinfectant cleaner or Lysol® Disinfecting Wipes to help clean the sink, taps, drains and surrounding surfaces to kill any germs. When used as directed, Lysol® Disinfecting Wipes kill 99.9% of bacteria.</li>
				<li>The fridge needs to be deep cleaned at least once a month. Wipe down the shelves using a disinfectant cleaner, and throw away any food that has gone bad to discourage bacterial growth.</li>
				<li>The trash can is an obvious hotbed for nasty germs and bacteria. It’s important to disinfect your trash can each time you take the garbage out. Lysol® Brand Concentrate Disinfectant is a good choice for cleaning trash can interiors and lids.</li>
				<li>Chopping boards and food preparation surfaces are easily contaminated when we prepare foods. As well as using separate chopping boards for raw and cooked foods, you should always disinfect with a clean cloth and disinfectant cleaner after use.</li>
